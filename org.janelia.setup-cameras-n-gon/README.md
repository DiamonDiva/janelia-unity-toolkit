# Janelia Setup Cameras N-Gon

## Summary
This package (org.janelia.setup-cameras-n-gon) implements an editor to set up a rig of cameras arranged in an N-gon (e.g., a pentagon), optionally with one or more of the sides left "open" (without associated cameras).

## Installation
Follow the [installation instructions in the main repository](https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/janelia-unity-toolkit/blob/master/README.md#installation).

Beware that the installation will fail unless the package [org.janelia.camera-utilites](https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/janelia-unity-toolkit/tree/master/org.janelia.camera-utilities) has been installed already.  Unity does not support automatic installation of dependencies like this one when they are "local packages" cloned from GitHub (as of Unity version 2019.2.7f2, at least).
