# Janelia Full Screen View

## Summary
This package (org.janelia.full-screen-view) implements full-screen, no-border game views
that run with the Unity editor active, and an editor window
for managing what cameras are displayed in what views.
These views are useful for VR studies that use sets of adjacent
monitors to display the world to the animal (as opposed to using
a projector), as all the editor functionality is available for
fine-tuning the world while the animal is in it.

## Installation
Follow the [installation instructions in the main repository](https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/janelia-unity-toolkit/blob/master/README.md#installation).
